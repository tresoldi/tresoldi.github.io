# Software

I develop open-source tools for computational linguistics and data analysis. All projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tresoldi).

## Python Libraries

### nhandu
Literate programming for Python: write executable documents in plain .py files. Transforms Python files with markdown comments into reproducible reports with captured output, plots, and rich object rendering. Git-friendly alternative to Jupyter notebooks.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/tresoldi/nhandu](https://github.com/tresoldi/nhandu)
**PyPI:** [https://pypi.org/project/nhandu/](https://pypi.org/project/nhandu/)

### dafsa
Deterministic Acyclic Finite State Automaton library for efficient string matching and morphological analysis.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/tresoldi/dafsa](https://github.com/tresoldi/dafsa)
**PyPI:** [https://pypi.org/project/dafsa/](https://pypi.org/project/dafsa/)

### ngesh
Library for generating synthetic phylogenetic data for testing and validation of computational methods.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/tresoldi/ngesh](https://github.com/tresoldi/ngesh)
**PyPI:** [https://pypi.org/project/ngesh/](https://pypi.org/project/ngesh/)

### freqprob
Tools for computing frequency probabilities in linguistic datasets.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/tresoldi/freqprob](https://github.com/tresoldi/freqprob)

### asymcat
Statistical analysis of asymmetric categorical data with applications in typological research.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/tresoldi/asymcat](https://github.com/tresoldi/asymcat)

## C Tools

### acopost
Part-of-speech tagging system implemented in C for efficient text processing.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/tresoldi/acopost](https://github.com/tresoldi/acopost)

## Data Resources

### Arca Verborum
Comprehensive lexical database for computational historical linguistics. Analysis-ready datasets from Lexibank with 149 collections covering 2.9 million language forms across 9,700+ languages. Provides denormalized CSV files optimized for rapid method development and teaching. [Project page](https://www.tresoldi.org/arcaverborum)

## Philosophy

My software development follows these principles:

- **Open Source**: All tools are freely available
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Testing**: Robust test suites for reliability
- **Standards**: Following community best practices
- **Reproducibility**: Enabling reproducible research workflows

## Installation & Usage

Most Python packages can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install package-name
```

See individual repositories for specific installation instructions and usage examples.
