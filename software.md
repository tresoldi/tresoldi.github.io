# Software

I develop open-source tools for computational linguistics and data analysis. All projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tresoldi).

## Python Libraries

### dafsa
Deterministic Acyclic Finite State Automaton library for efficient string matching and morphological analysis.

**Repository:** [github.com/tresoldi/dafsa](https://github.com/tresoldi/dafsa)

### ngesh
Library for generating synthetic phylogenetic data for testing and validation of computational methods.

**Repository:** [github.com/tresoldi/ngesh](https://github.com/tresoldi/ngesh)

### freqprob
Tools for computing frequency probabilities in linguistic datasets.

**Repository:** [github.com/tresoldi/freqprob](https://github.com/tresoldi/freqprob)

### asymcat
Statistical analysis of asymmetric categorical data with applications in typological research.

**Repository:** [github.com/tresoldi/asymcat](https://github.com/tresoldi/asymcat)

## C Tools

### acopost
Part-of-speech tagging system implemented in C for efficient text processing.

**Repository:** [github.com/tresoldi/acopost](https://github.com/tresoldi/acopost)

## Other Projects

*Additional software projects and tools will be listed here as they are developed.*

## Philosophy

My software development follows these principles:

- **Open Source**: All tools are freely available
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Testing**: Robust test suites for reliability
- **Standards**: Following community best practices
- **Reproducibility**: Enabling reproducible research workflows

## Installation & Usage

Most Python packages can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install package-name
```

See individual repositories for specific installation instructions and usage examples.
