Welcome to my new academic website! This site will serve as a hub for my research in computational historical linguistics, software projects, and occasional thoughts on data science and academic life.

## What you'll find here

- **Research**: My work on phylogenetic methods, South American languages, and computational linguistics
- **Software**: Open-source tools I develop for linguistic analysis and data science
- **Blog**: Thoughts on research methods, programming, and academic life

## Current focus

I'm particularly excited about my ongoing work with native South American languages and the development of new computational methods for historical linguistics. The intersection of traditional linguistic methods with modern data science approaches offers fascinating opportunities for discovery.

Stay tuned for more posts about specific projects, methodological insights, and the occasional technical deep-dive!
