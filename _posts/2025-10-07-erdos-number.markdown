I decided to check and I am proud to report that my Erdős number is 5. The path runs through Johann-Mattis List (historical linguistics), Alexandros Stamatakis (phylogenetics), Yishay Mansour (machine learning), Noga Alon (combinatorics), and finally Paul Erdős himself. Five degrees of collaborative separation from the mathematician who lived out of a suitcase, published 1,500 papers with 511 coauthors, and believed the Supreme Fascist kept all the elegant proofs in the Book.
