# Tiago Tresoldi

I am an **Insight Analyst** at [Etraveli](https://www.etraveli.com) in Uppsala, Sweden, and an **Affiliate Researcher** at the [Department of Linguistics and Philology](https://www.lingfil.uu.se/english/) of Uppsala University.

My research focuses on **computational historical linguistics**, particularly the study of native South American languages, with emphasis on phylogenetic methods, data management, and scientific reproducibility.

I completed my Ph.D. in History of Literature with a thesis on the classical as a means of relationship with otherness, as showcased by the literary development of Odysseus.
