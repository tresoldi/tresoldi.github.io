# Research

My research focuses on computational historical linguistics, with particular emphasis on native South American languages and phylogenetic methods.

## Current Projects

### Arca Verborum
Large-scale lexical database for computational historical linguistics. [Project page](https://www.tresoldi.org/arcaverborum)

### PhyloVector
Vector-based approaches to phylogenetic analysis in historical linguistics.

### Uralic Language Phylogeny
Computational methods for understanding relationships within the Uralic language family.

### Arawan Family Analysis
Phylogenetic study of the Arawan language family of South America.

### Large Language Models in Production
Extensive work with LLMs both via APIs and locally deployed systems for linguistic analysis.

### Tafl Game Programming
Computer game development inspired by chess programming techniques for ancient Nordic board games.
