# Research

My research focuses on computational historical linguistics, with particular emphasis on native South American languages and phylogenetic methods.

## Current Projects

### PhyloVector
Vector-based approaches to phylogenetic analysis in historical linguistics.

### Uralic Language Phylogeny
Computational methods for understanding relationships within the Uralic language family.

### Arawan Family Analysis
Phylogenetic study of the Arawan language family of South America.

### Large Language Models in Production
Extensive work with LLMs both via APIs and locally deployed systems for linguistic analysis.

### Tafl Game Programming
Computer game development inspired by chess programming techniques for ancient Nordic board games.

## Collaborations

I collaborate with researchers at various institutions, including:
- Uppsala University (Department of Linguistics and Philology)
- Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History
- Various South American universities and research centers

## Research Philosophy

I am committed to:
- **Open Science**: Making research data and methods openly available
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring research can be independently verified
- **Collaboration**: Working across disciplines and institutions
- **Community Engagement**: Involving language communities in research processes
