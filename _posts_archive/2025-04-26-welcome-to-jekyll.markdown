So here's the thing about blogs: they promise continuity, this steady accumulation of thoughts that builds into something. But maybe what we need is the opposite—the permission to fragment, to start over without pretending there's a through-line. Benjamin's angel of history, after all, faces backward while being blown into the future, seeing only the pile of debris. Maybe that's closer to how thinking actually works.

I'm trying to get back at blogposting again. Not picking up where I left off (wherever that was), but starting from here, from this specific moment of wanting to write something that isn't a paper or a commit message or a report. Something that can be associative, that can follow the actual shape of thinking rather than the shape we're told thinking should have.

The space exists. Let's see if I can make it work this time.

(I will think more of this in terms of Luhmann's zettelkasten—maybe that's the model that makes sense here. But that's for another post.)
