# Large Language Models in Production

I have extensive experience working with large language models in production environments, encompassing both API-based solutions and locally deployed systems.

## Production Experience

### API-Based LLM Integration
- Integration of commercial LLM APIs into business workflows
- Performance optimization and cost management for large-scale deployments
- Building robust pipelines for real-time and batch processing
- Error handling and fallback strategies for production reliability

### Local LLM Deployment
- Self-hosted model deployment and optimization
- Hardware configuration and resource management
- Model quantization and optimization techniques
- Custom inference pipelines for specialized tasks

## Technical Applications

### Linguistic Analysis
- Automated text processing and analysis workflows
- Cross-lingual applications for historical linguistics research
- Phonological and morphological pattern recognition
- Integration with traditional computational linguistics tools

### Data Processing
- Large-scale text corpus processing and analysis
- Automated annotation and classification systems
- Quality assurance and validation frameworks
- Reproducible research pipelines

### Business Intelligence
- Natural language interfaces for data analysis
- Automated report generation and summarization
- Content classification and organization systems
- Customer interaction analysis and optimization

## Technical Stack

**APIs & Services:**
- OpenAI GPT models
- Anthropic Claude
- Google PaLM/Gemini
- Custom API integrations

**Local Deployment:**
- Llama 2/3 family models
- Mistral models
- Custom fine-tuned models
- Quantized model optimization

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker containerization
- GPU acceleration (CUDA/ROCm)
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Cloud and on-premises deployment

## Philosophy & Best Practices

My approach to LLM integration emphasizes:

- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and monitoring
- **Efficiency**: Cost-effective resource utilization
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent results across deployments
- **Ethics**: Responsible AI practices and bias mitigation
- **Security**: Data privacy and model safety considerations

## Research Integration

I actively explore the intersection of LLMs with computational historical linguistics, investigating applications in:

- Automated analysis of historical texts
- Cross-linguistic pattern detection
- Phylogenetic hypothesis generation
- Data augmentation for low-resource languages
